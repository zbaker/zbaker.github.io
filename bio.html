	<h2>Bio</h2>

	<p>I am a Junior level student and Eastern Washington University. My major is Computer Information Systems. I also have a minor in Japanese, and one in 3D modeling and animation. I am pursuing a CIS major because I have a strong passion for technology. I would love to pursue a career in the fast moving and rewarding programming field. When I am not coding, I enjoy drawing, 3D modeling, and reading. Currently, I am looking for a summer internship so I can start getting involved in the industry. </p>
